Setting up Java 11 and Java REPL

* Please install Java 11 on your system.
** https://adoptopenjdk.net/ has resources to help one install it.
** Use command 'java -version' to verify if Java 11 was successfully installed

* Go to terminal and type command 'jshell' and hit enter.
* A REPL for Java should appear.


Setting up the Tutorial: 
* When you clone this repository, in the resources folder you will find a tags.csv.zip file
* Please unzip it
* Go to Tutorials.java, change the value of the variables "PATH_SONGS" and "PATH_TAGS" appropriately

Note: I will be updating this repository until the Tuesday afternoon, so you might have to fetch the latest before FPC/CS 563 meeting.
